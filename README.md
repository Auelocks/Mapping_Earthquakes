# Mapping_Earthquakes
populate a geographical map with GeoJSON earthquake data

## Basic Project Plan
Visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes around the world using a URL for GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website and retrieve geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes for seven days. Then add the data to a map.

JavaScript and the D3.js library are used to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data. The Leaflet library is used to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and create interactivity for the earthquake data.
